# Automating OpenStack Infrastructure Deployment with Jenkins and Terraform

## Overview

This repository automates the deployment of OpenStack infrastructure using Jenkins and Terraform. The integration of Jenkins for continuous integration and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning streamlines the deployment process, ensuring efficiency, reproducibility, and scalability.

## Features

- **Jenkins Pipeline Integration:**
  - Orchestrate and automate the deployment workflow using Jenkins.
- **Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
  - Define and manage OpenStack infrastructure using Terraform scripts.
- **Continuous Integration:**
  - Ensure consistent and reliable infrastructure deployment with automated testing and validation.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure the following software is installed:

- **Jenkins Server**
- **Terraform**
- **OpenStack Credentials**

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Automating-OpenStack-Infrastructure-Deployment.git

    Navigate to the Project Directory:

    bash

    cd Automating-OpenStack-Infrastructure-Deployment

    Configuration:
        Update Jenkinsfile and Terraform scripts with your specific configurations and parameters.

    Jenkins Setup:
        Configure a Jenkins job to execute the Jenkinsfile for automated OpenStack infrastructure deployment.

    Terraform Execution:
        Run Terraform commands to initialize, plan, and apply the infrastructure changes.

Usage

Follow these steps to deploy OpenStack infrastructure using the provided automation:

    Trigger the Jenkins job.
    Monitor the Jenkins job console output for progress and potential issues.
    Verify the deployed infrastructure on the OpenStack dashboard.
    Make necessary adjustments to the Terraform scripts or Jenkinsfile for customization.
